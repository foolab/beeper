Installation instructions
--------------------------------------

Simple:
--------------------------------
As root, run the included install.sh from this directory.  This should
compile the kernel module, install it to the modules directory, and
activate it.  It will also create /dev/beep with fairly lax permissions
so that any user can run a beepd.  This should not have any significant 
security implications, but the paranoid should probably install by hand.

You can then run any of the included beeper daemons.  It is usually
best to run them as the user logged in on the console, at login time,
so as not to tie up the sound device.  However, if your system uses
ALSA, you could use the beepd_aplay.py daemon along with the
beepd.init SysV init script to run a system-wide beeper daemon at boot
time.   This might not be preferred, for security reasons, but it's an
option. 

Manual:
---------------------------------
You should be able to compile the kernel module just by running 'make'
(it may be necessary to do this as root depending on the permissions
of your kernel sources).  Then you can copy beepd.ko to your modules
directory (/lib/modules/VERSION/kernel/drivers/input/misc/,
preferably), 'depmod -a', and 'modprobe beep'.  You can create
/dev/beep by running 'mknod /dev/beep c 10 128', though this is
unnecessary if you are using devfs (deprecated in 2.6) or udev
(preferred).  You should also either make the beep device file world
readable, or, preferably, add it to /etc/security/console.perms (or
the equivalent) so that it will be chowned as needed to the console
user.

You can then run one of the included beeper daemons, or write one of
your own using those as an example.
